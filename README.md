## Introduction

Course repository for the Coursera Data Science Specialization Capstone as part
of the Data Science Specialization offered through Coursera from Johns Hopkins
University.

### Course Dataset

The training data set listed below will be used to get started and will be the
basis for most of the capstone.

### Milestone Report

Week 2 of the Data Science Capstone project covers *Exploratory Data Analysis*
and *Modeling*. The goal is to develop an understanding of the various
statistical properties of the data set that can be later used when building the
prediction model for the final data product.

At the end of week 2, students are asked to create a Milestone Report that
includes a description of the major features of the training data based on our
exploratory data analysis and to summarize our plans for creating the text
predictive model.

### Final Project Submission

The goal for this final project assignment is to implement a learning model for
text prediction. Using the text prediction algorithm, create a product in Shiny
that provides a user interface that can be accessed by users.

This repository contains the `ui.R` and `server.R` source code files for the
developed Shiny application as well as the RStudio Presenter files.
